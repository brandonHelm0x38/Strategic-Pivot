            I pointed out on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5Ed3byekgY&rco=1">About Me</a> page, that the Gulf of Tonkin incident that lead to the Vietnam conflict's escalation could be avoided through the right collaboration strategy between military technologies.<br>
            <br>
            I suggest we tie radar grids together... such that nations aren't losing sleep worrying about one another's capabilities. It's foolish if you understand our potential.<br>
            <br>
            The systems that drive targeting and weapons use authorization... still are controlled by each ship indepenetly... or however the military wants to safegaurd their operational necessities for defense.  However... it's very reasonable to have certain updates streamlined to central cloud systems for investigation purposes.<br>
            <br>
            The key grid we could be all working on together... A missile alert system for sure... and possibly the primary guidance algorithms infrastructures.  If a nation detected a launch... It would be useful if any nation had the ability to disable advanced targeting systems.  It's possible the algorithm can be built to steer targeting systems away from densely populated areas.  As part of a treaty... we can agree to never target urban population targets.  There are still other technologies that can accomplish precision strikes without a GPS aided system.  The primary technology of today... is precision AI drone operations.<br>
            <br>
            We should be moving away from bomb strikes, and towards cooperating with other nations to promote global stability in the AI age.  Creating AI weapons of Mass Destruction is foolish.  And not moving confidently into the AI age leaves the world open to extortion by vested interests.  So... all nations want to start working on specific library control strategies and joint-approved, multi-agency code review process.  If we aren't making it easy to police drone development through inter-connected library screening strategies... we arenj't seriously trying to help people safely pursue equal opportunity.<br>
            <br>
            Global development could easily be controlled and extorted by people limiting access to opportunity... and then just stealing ideas while trying to argue some parties can't be trusted.  That could get to a very dangerous stage of corruption driving global affairs.

            In only trying to police it... we will never come to understand it.<br>
            <br>
            Drug counseling programs often make the mistake of shutting down conversations and thus prolonging the struggle.<br>
            They like to beat people down into believing they are simply justifying their actions, when the self-medication piece is usually a consistent trend.<br>
            <br>
            I agree that there is confusion to sort through.  You want people to realize and understand stronger coping strategies.<br>
            <br>
            If we're bold enough to really try to manage it, we will get further.<br>
            There wasn't an opportunity to do this effectively before technology reached a critical threshold.<br>
            <br>
            <b>We need to track and regulate everything sold.</b><br>
            <b>This data must be correlated with Lumosity perfomance metrics...</b><br>
            <b>As well as journaling trends that can uncover the depths and tone of how reflections might be shaped.</b><br>
            <br>
            Mind your thoughts, for your thoughts become your actions.<br>
            <br>
            The other technological piece now possible...<br>
            We can make it impossible for packaging to be tampered with... and thus anything inside the package to be altered.<br>
            In this way, we can much more effectively regulate and police the drug use networks.<br>
            <br>
            I suspect, as in my life... the complex dynamic we can't see playing out... Is the truth some of these experiences do leave people believing their "Consciousness has been expanded".  What drives this perception is a very complex set of dyanmics.  In the current atmosphere, many give up on trying to battle through societies confusion... as well as their own.  I know this from first-hand experience.<br>
            <br>
            So often, people are self-medicating... believing that these experiences help them to draw certain thoughts out.  Some of this is driven by confounding variables they don't really understand.  Up late at night in an inebriated state... people need something to do... and they usually talk about a lot of different things.  This can leave people believing they found something in those moments... when the truth is the environment simply promoted a small piece of the opportunity for that to happen.<br>
            <br>
            This all gets very complicated for the user... because they usually have the same conversations numerous times thinking they found something... when they've barely worked through those thoughts.  So often... because society is against so many of these decisions... they have a cynical attitude towards those who don't admit the potential for these perceptions, however short-sighted they may be.<br>
            <br>
            Many using-circles are also very confused by the confounding variables.  I've heard people say "Some people just shouldn't do drugs", and they generally believe they can handle things others can't.  I can tell you... I struggled more because I was trying to make sense of so many things... and so many others around me were using more just for the feeling of being high.  They don't understand the people who end up in a roller-coaster of emotions, driven largely by their comprehension they're on the edge of understanding something bigger.<br>
            <br>
            So often they just spin their wheels, because they aren't in the best environment to really work through those thoughts.  Many around them just think they are struggling due to an inherent weakness, rather than the complexity of what's spinning inside of them.<br>
            <br>
            If people are bold... we can now position the science to really figure this out, create the opportunity to really correlate this science effectively, and truly help people spinning in this confusion.
